                    <h2>Space Launch Experience Spacecraft</h2>
                    <p>Named after Mercury Seven, the first group of NASA astronauts selected for space travel under Project Mercury, the Astral Expeditions M7 is one of the most technologically advanced spacecraft ever. The M7 brings the luxury of a jetliner with the authenticity of a NASA shuttle launch to provide a truly unique space launch experience.</p>

                <h2>Built for pure power. All reusable.</h2>
                <p>Our AEM7 Engine launches the M7 Spacecraft into Earth’s orbit at approximately 18,000 mph in 8.5 minutes, about the time that a NASA shuttle takes to reach orbit. Passengers will experience about 3Gs during the launch experience.</p>

            <div class="tech-text-1">
                <h2>Safety Features</h2>
                <p>Along with two professionally-trained M7 Spacecraft pilots, the M7 Spacecraft is equipped with emergency boosters and parachutes that can be activated by the pilots or Mission Control Center. When activated, the emergency boosters will propel the M7 back to Earth and parachutes will deploy automatically at 9,000 feet altitude to safely land the M7 Spacecraft into the ocean. Our 24/7 Emergency Response team will make contact with the spacecraft and provide further instruction.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by the historic Apollo 11 mission, the first space mission that landed humans on the moon, the Astral Expeditions A11 is the most advanced spacecraft ever built for lunar travel. The A11 combines world-class hospitality services with some of the world’s most advanced aerospace engineering to provide passengers with an unparalleled space travel experience.</p>

                <p>Along with two professionally-trained A11 Spacecraft pilots experienced in space travel, the A11 Spacecraft’s passenger capsule can be detached from the engine in case of an emergency by the pilots or from the Mission Control Center. Powerful boosters and emergency parachutes attached to the capsule that will be activated upon detachment will aid the A11 upon reentry and landing. Parachutes will deploy automatically at 9,000 feet altitude to safely land the A11 Spacecraft into the ocean. Our 24/7 Emergency Response team will make contact with the spacecraft and provide further instruction.</p>
